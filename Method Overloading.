The concept of method overloading can be explained with the following example
as asked in the question where the method sum() is introduced in the program.

The class Main is created with the main() method as default. 

The new method Sum() is introduced with integer a and b like int a, int b in the round brackets.
The output statement is typed in the curly brackets of the Sum() method . 

Now the name of the new method "Sum()" is typed in the main method.
The values of integer a and b are given in the round brackets of the Sum() in the main method.

When executed the value of the integer in the main() method executed from the operation statement in 
the Sum() method.
